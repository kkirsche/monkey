package ast

/*
	Package ast is responsible for the Abstract Syntax Tree structure of the
	Monkey programing language.

	An abstract syntax tree is the representation of the source code which removes
	helper concepts like braces and semicolons and instead stores the intent of
	the code which it represents.
