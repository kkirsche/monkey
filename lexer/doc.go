package lexer

/*
	Package lexer implements the Lexer for the Monkey programming language. A
	lexer is responsible for reading input text, in this case the Monkey
	programming language source code, and then tokenizing it into the significant
	tokens for that language. The tokens for Monkey are defined separately in the
	token package.
